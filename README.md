# brca-capstone

This project predicts whether breast lesion fine needle aspirate biopsies are malignant or benign based on machine learning analysis of features extracted from digitized images of cytology slides. Data are from the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). It was originally written as my capstone project for the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate.
